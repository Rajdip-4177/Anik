# **App Name**: Anik's Eternal Echo

## Core Features:

- Journey Timeline: Animated timeline displaying key memories from Class 6 to Class 10, each marked with relevant emojis or illustrations. Soft scrolling will guide the user through our shared history.
- Quote Showcase: A dynamic quote display, presenting friendship and brotherhood quotes that resonate with our bond. Quotes gently fade in as the user scrolls.
- Heartfelt AI Message: Personalized message generator tool: when activated, this generates a custom heartfelt letter or message from Rajdip to Anik, adding an intimate and unique touch.
- Celebration Finale: Interactive fireworks or Lottie animation to celebrate Anik’s birthday, coupled with a final popup message solidifying our bond.
- Inside Joke: Easter egg integration of a joke only Anik and Rajdip understand. This is an easily discoverable (but not immediately obvious) addition to make Anik smile.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Warm coral (#FF7F50) to evoke feelings of warmth and friendship.
- Background color: Light peach (#FAF0E6), a soft and desaturated tint of coral, creates a gentle backdrop.
- Accent color: Soft lavender (#E6E6FA), analogous to coral, but providing contrast as it's desaturated. The gentle desaturation helps match the general soft theme of the app.
- Use “Pacifico” or handwritten styles for headings and "Roboto" or clean sans-serif for body text.
- Illustrations or icons should use a consistent, hand-drawn style.
- Incorporate confetti/balloons falling, glowing sparkles, scroll-triggered appearance, and animated birthday cake-cutting for an immersive experience.
